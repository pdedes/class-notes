MongoDB Quick Reference Guide

	Launch MongoDB in terminal using...
		$ mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

	show dbs 	displays a list of available databases
	use [dbname]	loads the database with name [dbname]
	show collections	displays document collections in the database	

	Querying with Selectors
		A selector is similar to an SQL WHERE clause. You pass an object {} along to the database, empty being 'return all'. If you restrict it with the following keys, it will add constraints to your search

		$lt 	less than
		$lte 	less than or equal to
		$gt 	greater than
		$gte 	greater than or equal to
		$ne 	not equal to
		$eq 	equal to

		$exists: true/false 	choose boolean
		$in: used to match one of several values we pass in an array format
		$nin: matches values that are explicityly not in the passed array
		$or: used to match one of several selector objects

		Evaluation Searches

			$mod 	performs a modulo evaluation on the field
			$regex 	docs matching a regular expression
			$text 	performs a text search
			$where 	returns documents satisfying a javascript function

		Note: All of these selectors can not only be used with .find(), but also with:
			.remove()
			.count() 	Returns the number of results of entered query
			.update()

		Note, for more Query Selectors: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/#query-selectors



		Sample Queries

			.find({field1: valueA, field2: valueB}) 	Returns statements where both are true

			.find({age: {$gte: 25}}); 	Returns documents where age is greater than or equal to 25

			.find({has_passport: {$exists: true}}); 	Returns documents where the field "has_passport" exists

			.find({
				loves: {$in: ['apples', 'peaches']}
			});

			.find({
				gender: "f",
				$or: [{loves: 'apple'}, 
					 {weight: {$lt: 700}}]
			})

				^^^Notice that $or recieves an Array of selector objects...

	Mongo treats Arrays as first class Objects.

		loves: {'peaches'} 	returns any document where 'peaches' is a value in the loves field.

	Adding .pretty() to a shell statement will format the results in a readable fashion. This can be set to default if needed via Mongo config file.

	UPDATING RECORDS

		Be careful, using the .update() command in its basic form will overwrite the document COMPLETELY with the object you are passing. Using an UPDATE OPERATOR with your query is the proper way to update documents in Mongo, without overwriting.

			WRONG way
				
				db.horses.update({name: "Shadowfax"}, {rider: "Gandalf the Grey"});

				// this will replace the entire document

			CORRECT way

				db.horses.update({name: "Shadowfax"}, {$set: {rider: "Gandalf the Grey"}});

		All update operators work on fields, so there's no worry about wiping away entire documents if you utilize them, as there was if you omitted them.

		Update Operators:

			$set
			$inc 		increments by the stated amount (can be negative)
			$push		adds a value to a field
			$mul 		multiplies the value by the passed amount
			$rename		renames a field
			$setOnInsert 	Useful for setting defaults (note, upsert must be set to true)

		Upsert: An action that updates the document if it exists, or inserts it if it does not exist

			// This first example does not inclue an upsert, therefore nothing happens if the document does not exist

			db.hits.update({page: 'teams'}, {$inc: {hits: 1}});

			// The time we include {upsert: true}, forcing an action even if the document doesn't exist.
			// Running this a second time will update the document we created the first time

			db.hits.update({page: 'unicorns'}, {$inc: {hits: 1}}, {upsert:true});

		By default, Update Operators execute once. To get a multiple-document execution statement, you'll need to use {multi: true}.
