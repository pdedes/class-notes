HASH TABLES...
________

	IN JS, you don't have access to strict arrays like you do in C. We need to simulate this in JS as follows:

		function Hash () {
			this.numBuckets = 25;		// We'll use this to sim the array size
			this.buckets = [];			// Initialized array
		}

	typeof returns a string, which is why we put the checked item in quotes:
		>>For ex: alternatively you could check (key.constructor !== String) to check key is built from the String class.

	Note: Install ack for code searching

	Why do we 'AddToHead' of the linked list instead of AddToTail? The principle used here is recency; that there's a better chance the latest inserted data will be needed sooner. If you place it at the end, you're almost guaranteeing a longer O(n) runtime.

	Hash.prototype.get... You shouldn't consider 'search' a method that you can change. How can we otherwise extract the 'key' from the HashNode without modifying Linked List search?

		Nimit's Aside: By modifying .valueOf(), we can hack the '===' check to return the value of the HashNode instead of the entire HashNode object. Out of the box, when comparing objects, using '==' or '===' utilizes the Object.prototype.valueOf() method.

		BTW: Shutting down node/console will reset primitives to their native state.

SEARCH TREES...
________

	The HTML DOM is actually a tree

	<HTML>
		<HEAD>
		<BODY>
			<DIV>
				<P>

	Sizzle was the first selector engine that helped style pages using JavaScript. jQuery was extremely popular from 2004-2010... but now that's also on the way out.

	document.querySelectorAll('head')
		>>will give me the head tag

	document.querySelectorAll('.photo')
		>>will return the images in the page

	Servers can now execute JS at various time frames of each site. This helps google see javascript apps even after they've loaded.
