	prototype.merge {}
		Use Object.keys(objName).forEach( function (){
			obj1[key] = obj2[key];
		})
		//This will cause problems later on

	prototype.count {}
		return this.exec().length;

	try to use '.forEach' more often

	SELECT and WHERE operate on different axes of the table
		Where on the y
		Select on the x
			>Underscore has a function called 'pluck' which does this

	Order
		.sort() will mutate the array in place using the function that you pass it. Since it does do it in place, you do not need to pass the value into a new variable to store it.

	You need to return to prototype.where to make sure it takes Indexing into account.

	Indexing
		Since any change to a table will corrupt the index, it's better to have it run on the ID of the row.

	FQL (this workshop) will resemble the way we interact with databases later on using Mongoose DB.
